This project was created for DataFest 2017 at Vassar College.

Gathering data from Expedia, my team (Kentaro Kaneki, Michelle Lam, Steven Park, Marian Lam, and I) performed multivariate regression, GIS visualization, and cluster analysis to identify particular groups of individuals and see what factors mattered the most to them. It appears that most people tend to book in the afternoon instead of the night and that there were two primary groups of individuals that could be most easily parsed: leisure vs. business travel. Seasonality by and large did not affect the behaviors of people (in aggregate), although it certainly affected the number of people booking travels. You can see with our Sankey diagrams (the weird flowing graphs) a nice representation of how the number and type of people that book change their behaviors according to hotel pricing and seasons.
