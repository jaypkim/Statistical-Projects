## This project was created for DataFest 2016 at Vassar College. My team (Mi Rae Shin, So Sun Park, Peter Kim, Kevin Cosgrove, and I) 
wanted to explore how the type of media we use affect our browsing behaviors from data by Ticketmaster. 
Does the experience of being on a mobile device lend itself to a different experience than being on a PC? 

Well, apparently yes it does. The data we used here was more exploratory in nature, as various factors, 
such as differences in UX (from desktop vs mobile websites) and demographics, were not explicitly modeled for. Some interesting results from this project were the relative insignificance of paid reach vs. organic reach in traffic flow, differential purchasing behavior as the days drew closer to the event, and differential source flow to the Ticketmaster website based on devices.
