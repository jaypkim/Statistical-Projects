## WORK IN PROGRESS

As an unemployed and recent college graduate, I've had quite some time to think about how I've changed since high school. In what ways has life changed me, and how have I reacted to those changes? An easy way to understand this is by analyzing how the way I communicate has changed. Semantic structures and patterns can reveal a lot about how we treat others and how we present ourselves to people, abstractions that are fundamental to the conception of identity. To do so, I decided to use my Facebook chat data. How has the way I communicate evolved over the years, and what may this reveal about how I've changed as a person?
